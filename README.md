# readsb_atc_gui
ATC-style flight strip representations for aircraft seen by readsb.

Given one or more KML files describing some bounding boxes / gates, 
this script will attach to a readsb JSON socket, and report when flights are inside the bounding boxes.
Command-line and a Kivy-based GUI are available.
